# Image_Demorpher_Using_Machine_Learning_Removing_Fake



## Overview
This project focuses on developing an image demorpher using machine learning techniques to detect and remove morphing effects from images. Morphing is a technique often used to alter faces or objects in images, leading to fake or manipulated visuals. The demorphing process aims to restore the original appearance of the subjects in the images by leveraging deep learning models.

### Features
- Identification and removal of morphing artifacts from images.
- Utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning morphing patterns.
- Enhancement of image authenticity and integrity.
- Integration with existing image processing pipelines.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for model training.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library for preprocessing and postprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for data preprocessing and evaluation.

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used for training and testing the demorphing model. Include details such as the number of images, sources, and any preprocessing steps applied to the dataset.

## Architecture
Explain the architecture of the demorphing system, detailing the model structure, training process, and how it identifies and removes morphing effects from images.

## Installation
